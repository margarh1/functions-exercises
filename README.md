Reflection: I didn't have much trouble with the first nine problems and managed to figure out how to successfully write a function for the last one. I think it's a shame that the .padStart and .padEnd functions don't work on Chrome, as they likely would've made the last problem easier to solve, but I found a way around it. Otherwise, I need to look up how to use regular expressions in JavaScript because I'm *definitely* planning on using them in future functions.
